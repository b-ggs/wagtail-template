# wagtail_template

## About

This project aims to provide a production-ready base for **Wagtail 3.0** and **Django 4.0.** projects while still being fairly minimal enough to easily take apart and make your own.

Out of the box, this project can be easily deployed to Heroku or Dokku.

## TODO

This project is a constant work in progress. Here are some things I want to add to this project at some point:

- [ ] [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) support
- [ ] Full [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) compliance
- [ ] Examples for running Wagtail in headless mode
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] HTTPS in development
- [ ] Makefile or similar for development shortcuts
